This git should only be used if you want to take a bunch of .json files, search through them and then find a particular artist or 
song title within these files. Dubtrack.fm has no mass playlist search or filter so this will work only if you use this bookmarklet managed by JTBrinkmann https://github.com/JTBrinkmann/Dubtrack-Playlist-Pusher
